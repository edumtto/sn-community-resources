  <h2 class="section-title">About the Editor</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a local software developer with a background in building native iOS and web applications. After leading projects for social platforms and fintechs, I wanted to apply those skills closer to home. South Natomas Gold was born from a desire to create a clean, modern space for my neighbors to find high-quality information without the clutter of traditional social media.
